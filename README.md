# Gradient-cheking
result of the project:
Implement gradient checking to verify the accuracy of your backprop implementation
Problem Statement:
You are part of a team working to make mobile payments available globally, and are asked to build a deep learning model to detect fraud--whenever someone makes a payment, you want to see if the payment might be fraudulent, such as if the user's account has been taken over by a hacker.

You already know that backpropagation is quite challenging to implement, and sometimes has bugs. Because this is a mission-critical application, your company's CEO wants to be really certain that your implementation of backpropagation is correct. Your CEO says, "Give me proof that your backpropagation is actually working!" To give this reassurance, you are going to use "gradient checking."


warning: I did this project from my courses in  coursera.org so if you have this project please dont check the codes it is so important to think about them by yourself
